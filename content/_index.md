# Welcome to my English Blog

I have been writing Chinese blogs for many years. The current [Chinese blog](https://justgoidea.com) started in 2015. During this period, I used WordPress, Typecho, Notion, and finally chose Hugo. But I also really like Zola and the Bear Theme. 

Why don't I build an English website to use my favorite Zola and Bear? I asked myself.

So, I built this English blog and translated some of my articles into English and publish them.

English has always been my second language. I was very proficient in it when I was in New Zealand, but I became unfamiliar with it after returning to China. I hope that one day I can write in English again like I used to.
